A demo webservice with demo security issues
-------------------------------------------

This is a simple little demo webservice that re-creates
a couple of real-life security issues that I've seen in
the past (OK OK, that I've *shipped* in the past).

To run it locally:

  * Install nodejs v6 or later, and a local SMTP server
  * `npm install`
  * `node ./server.js`
